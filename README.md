# XMLTree

This is a fork of [XMLTree](http://www.mitya.co.uk/scripts/Presenting-XMLTree-v-186) by Mitya.
He gave permission to publish the source on github under MIT license.

The documentation on his page is still valid.

A minimal example and links to the blog posts are available at https://koppor.github.com/xmltree.

This fork improves on this plugin by providing support for Angular and other JS Libs that can implement a JS Object.

Jquery is no longer required and output is a JS Object.

Until this stage, Any JS lib can initiate the Xmltree function and obtain a JS Object. 

This means that traversing the tree and rendering the tree is in the hands of the user.

As part of this fork, AngularJS Directive is used to perform this option.
